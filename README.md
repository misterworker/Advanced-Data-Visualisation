# Advanced Data Visualisation Project

This project is an interactive data visualization dashboard built using **D3.js** for data analysis. The dashboard includes interactive filters that allow users to explore data dynamically.

## Features

- **D3.js-based Interactive Dashboard**  
  - Provides rich data visualizations.
  - Includes functional filters for data analysis.
- **Easy to Run**  
  - Simply **clone the repository** and open `index.html` in your browser.
- **Supplementary Analysis (Misc Folder)**  
  - `misc/` contains additional materials:
    - **Anki flashcards** to help memorize D3 concepts.
    - **A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** using Python's **Seaborn** to analyze a separate dataset (unrelated to D3.js).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/misterworker/Advanced-Data-Visualisation
   
2. Open `index.html` on your browser. Alternatively, you can watch the Dashboard Analysis.mp4 video for an overview
